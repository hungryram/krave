                    <p>My name is Alejandro Garcia and I’m 27 years. Former professional soccer player, I played at Orlando City for 1 year and then took my career to Mexico for 4 years. My time as a professional I had no idea about nutrition, so imagine what your typical person knows about nutrition. I gained 25 lbs of lean muscle and it inspired me to show others what is possible with a balanced diet.</p>
